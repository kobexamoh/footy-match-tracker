# footy-match-tracker

At a high level, this is a way for users to track matches, view match details, and save their favourite matches. Users should be able to indicate if they watched a match and, if they want, can write up a short description of what they thought of it + if they'd recommend others rewatch it. They can select if certain players stood out to them, and if multiple users select the same player independently, snippets or aggregates of that feedback will be displayed on the match page for that specific player (or under that specific player's stats/scouting report).
